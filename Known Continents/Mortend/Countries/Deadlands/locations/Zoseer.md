<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Mortend]] → [[Deadlands]] → Zoseer</sup></sup>
Zoseer is a small town, closer to a village truly, nestled under the shadow of a large dune in the eastern [[Deadlands]] and home to the [[Nayax Clan]] of [[Dragonborn]]. The town is the remains of some ruins that the [[Nayax Clan|Nayax]] had discovered and unearthed before deciding to give up their nomadic ways to stay there. The streets and buildings are adorned with the multicolored [[Dragonglass]] that the [[Dragonborn]] are famous for blowing and the outside of the sanding wall in front of the town, an oasis is only a short walk away which provides the [[Nayax Clan|Nayax]] with everything they require in order to live, most notably clean water.
