<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Mortend]] → Parcël</sup></sup> 
Parcël is a fairly large island nation off the northwest coast of the continent of [[Mortend]]. The name, Parcël, comes from an ancient language and roughly translates into common as "Shrouded Isle" which fits the nation quite well due to the strange behavior of the [[Mistveil]] in the channel separating it from [[Mortend]]. The channel, aptly named the [[Mist Channel]], is littered with jagged stone landmasses that would already make it difficult to navigate to begin with but in addition, sporadic clusters of the [[Mistveil|Veil]] drift in from the ocean making traveling through the [[Mist Channel|channel]] even riskier. The island itself is made up of drastically disparate, at times nonsensical, climates and biomes which don't conform to the weather that would be expected so far north. It is unknown what is the cause of the strange environments on Parcël but there are many rumors including the influence of Ancient Dragons ages ago, different weather systems being influenced by what is on the "other side of the [[Mistveil|Veil]]", and the land being ravaged by strange magic long ago that forever changed its climate. The latter theory is the most commonly held and is paired with the myth that Parcël was once connected to the mainland of [[Mortend]] but some magical catastrophe separated it, creating the [[Mist Channel]] and apparently explaining its strange properties as well.
