<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Mortend]] → [[Parcël]] → Goblin Weald</sup></sup> 
A hilly forested area in central south [[Parcël]], the Goblin Weald is named for the numerous, ever shifting goblinoid clans that live in the forests and caves of the region. These clans are consistently being created, destroyed, enslaved, joined, and disbanded so keeping track of all of them is practically impossible but there are a handful of prominent, and usually warring, clans that have lasted for long enough to actually be known by groups outside of the forest.

The southern section of the Goblin Weald along the coast is much less forested and is the location where [[Esoria]] has decided is the easiest place to travel to from their ports. For this reason it is the location of both their current colony, [[New Voadlan]], as well as the ruins of their first attempt to colonize [[Parcël]].
