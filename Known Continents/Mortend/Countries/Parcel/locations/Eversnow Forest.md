<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Mortend]] → [[Parcël]] → Eversnow Forest</sup></sup>    
Located in northeastern-most [[Parcël]], the Eversnow Forest resides atop a raised plateau and stays in eternal winter. Although the majority of biomes on [[Parcël]] are strange for unknown reasons, the Eversnow Forest tracks its origin, as well as the origin of its inhabitants, the [[Wood Elves]], back to the [[Feywilds]]. This is because the Eversnow Forest is not native to [[Parcël]] but a planted wood who's saplings were brought to the land generations ago by [[Wood Elves|Wood Elf]] colonists who came from the [[Winter Court]]. The forest wraps around a pseudo-lake, kept thawed and warmed by volcanic vents deep underneath it. This body of water is home to a group of [[Merfolk]] who use submerged tunnels to move back and forth from the lake to the ocean coast.
