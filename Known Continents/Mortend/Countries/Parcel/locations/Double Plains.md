<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Mortend]] → [[Parcël]] → Double Plains</sup></sup>   
One of the largest regions on [[Parcël]], taking up nearly a third of the island's landmass, is the Double Plains located on the eastern side of the island and making up much of the eastern, as well as northern, coastlines. The large savanna is split into two sections, west and east, by a river formed at the base of a mountain range and running to, and around, the [[Bloodvine Jungle]]. The Double Plains is made up of swathes of grasslands with patches of hilly terrain mostly near the river and mountains. The area is home to many large creatures and two factions of beastfolk, the [[Amica]] that live primarily on the eastern half of the Plains and the [[Vafer]] who take up residence mostly on the west side of the Plains.
