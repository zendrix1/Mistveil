<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Mortend]] → [[Parcël]] → Tepid Bog</sup></sup>   
Spread across two islands in the chain of rivers that split [[Parcël]] into its eastern and western regions, the Tepid Bog is, as the name suggests, a muggy swamp that begins the transition into the warmer lands west. Although there are more dangerous creatures and more inhospitable regions elsewhere on [[Parcël]], the combination of the two have prevented any real settlement or culture from taking root in the swamp. What sentient creatures can be found there include small groups of nomadic [[Lizardfolk]] still clinging to the hopes of recapturing the homeland they were pushed out of, now known as the [[Feral Gardens]], and [[Hags|Hag]] covens that have taken up residence in the swamp themselves when not trying to corrupt and influence others around [[Parcël]].
