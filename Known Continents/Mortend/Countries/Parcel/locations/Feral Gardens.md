<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Mortend]] → [[Parcël]] → Feral Gardens</sup></sup>
Nestled in by a crescent, coastal mountain range in the southwest region of [[Parcël]], the Feral Gardens are a humid jungle home to many dangers, but none more lethal than the fiendish creatures that rule the area, the [[Rakshasa]]. The [[Rakshasa]] are the physical manifestations of fiendish spirits on the Material Plane who relish in opulent pleasures and cruelty, and usually take the form of humanoid shaped large cats but no matter what form they take, they all share one common feature, their hands are twisted backwards.

Although there is no shortage of threats native to the Feral Gardens, they also act as a twisted reflection of the [[Goblin Weald]] to the east due to the undead goblinoids that roam the jungle. This is because the [[Rakshasa]]'s preferred servants are the undead and the [[Ironbound Clan]] of [[Hobgoblins]] are more than happy to sell living and recently dead slaves to the [[Rakshasa]] in exchange for the magical aid and wealth the [[Rakshasa]] can provide. The [[Rakshasa]] have their undead servants roam the jungle as a representation of their grip on the region.

Under the mountains along the south coast of the Feral Gardens resides another mysterious group of small pale creatures known as [[Dromites]], who have insectoid traits and psionic abilities. There are many rumors about the [[Dromites]] including that they kidnap children and worship abhorrent extraplanar monsters.
