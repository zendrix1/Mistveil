<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Mortend]] → [[Parcël]] → Salesport Mines</sup></sup>  
The Salesport Mines found on two thin mountainous islands in the system of channels that split [[Parcël]] into it's two main landmasses. The islands are scarcely populated by native creatures but are the home of the industrious [[Vermane]] who have carved the earth underneath the islands into a web of mines. These mines hold a very unique resource that the [[Vermane]] extract and sell to any other faction on Parcël that will trade with them. That unique resource is the remains of giant beasts called [[Tarrasque]], who fell from the sky on a massive chunk of rock ages ago. It is unknown why the remains of the colossal creatures are found in this location or how they died to begin with, but unlike traditional organic creatures they do not rot upon death, instead their flesh turns to a metal-like ore and their blood crystalizes into literal veins of gemstones. Those two resources, as well as the everlasting carapace of the [[Tarrasque]], is what the [[Vermane]] gather and trade. In fact, the "[[Blood Rubies]]" traded by the [[Vermane]] are the closest thing to a universal currency on the island of [[Parcël]], as any faction who trades with the [[Vermane]] will accept them and even those who don't might find a use for the extremely rare commodity.
