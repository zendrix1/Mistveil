<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Mortend]] → [[Divine Kingdom of Baylore|Baylore]] → Cliffside</sup></sup>
A small mining town located on the western border of [[Divine Kingdom of Baylore|Baylore]], against the sheer cliffs of the [[Shielding Spine Mountains]]. Famous for the great forge in the center of the town and the mysterious mineral that is mined and refined there, [[Blackore]]. The chance to work with the substance and use the powerful forge has caused many craftsmen to move to the small town and attempt to become Forgemasters.

In [[Baylore's Calendar|Junian]] of 1486 DA the town was almost completely destroyed by a [[Formian]] raiding party but managed to fend off the attack at the cost of many of the citizens' lives.
