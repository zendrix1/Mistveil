<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Mortend]] → [[Divine Kingdom of Baylore|Baylore]] → [[Cliffside]] → Alec Fabari</sup></sup>
Alec Fabari, a young man living in [[Cliffside]], was the son of a prominent figure in the small town, [[Kurt Fabari]]. Alec was suppose to take over for his father in managing the town's expansive mines but unfortunately passed away before that was possible.

In the attack on [[Cliffside]] by the [[Formian]] raiding party on the 1st of [[Baylore's Calendar|Junian]], 1486 DA, Alec fought to protect his father and other members of the town, but ultimately succumbed to his wounds and died before any healer was able to help him.
