<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Mortend]] → [[Divine Kingdom of Baylore|Baylore]] → [[Cliffside]] → Brem Glorysun</sup></sup>
The younger cousin of [[Hessik Bristlehelm]], Brem Glorysun is one of the most experienced Forgemasters in [[Cliffside]]. He was once a member of the [[Bristlehelm Clan]] as well, but choose to forgo his claim to the clan in order to marry a human woman who he fell in love with, [[Selene Glorysun]]. He had to abandon his family name due to ancient tradition, but [[Hessik Bristlehelm|Hessik]] approved of the decision and still treats Brem like family. He tries to make a case to reinstitute Brem into the clan every time he visits the clan's home in the [[Kingdom of Razuth]], but so far has made little progress in convincing the clan's elders.
