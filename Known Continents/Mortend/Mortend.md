<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → Mortend</sup></sup>
One of the continents within the [[Mistveil]], Mortend is a land living in the shadow of a grand empire of undeath that ruled over the majority of the continent before it fell centuries ago. The lasting effects of that empire and the war that toppled it has caused large sections of land on Mortend to become barren and much more dangerous than they would be naturally.
