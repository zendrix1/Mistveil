**Benefits**: Three times per day, a Vampire with this talent can, as a standard action, influence the attitude of living creatures around them to be more pleasant unless they make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + ½ the Vampire's level + the Vampire's Charisma modifier), as per the *[Charm Person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person/)* spell (using the Vampire's level as the caster level).

Once the Vampire reaches 10th level, they are able to influence even more creatures than before. They can use this talent up to five times per day and can choose to either influence a single creature of any type, as per the *[Charm Monster](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-monster/)* spell, or influence several humanoids around them, as per the *[Mass Charm Person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person/)* spell.
