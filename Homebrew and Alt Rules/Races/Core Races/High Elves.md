<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Races]] → High Elves</sup></sup>
High Elves are taller than the average [[Humans|Human]] by about six to eight inches, tend to have more slender builds, and are known for their grace, wide eyes, and long pointed ears. Although their skin and hair colors vary wildly, just like [[Humans]], the most common High Elf has lighter toned skin and hair.
#### High Elves in [[Divine Kingdom of Baylore|Baylore]]
Long ago, the Elves of [[Mortend]] had their own culture and kingdom but they were one of the first victims of the rise of the [[Lord of Rot]]. All these years later, in [[Divine Kingdom of Baylore|Baylore]], the High Elves have joined the [[Humans|Human's]] culture near seamlessly. They may be underrepresented in [[Divine Kingdom of Baylore|Baylore's]] government (a fact that has led many to support the growing power of guilds in the country) but, short of very isolated events, they do not face much discrimination in [[Divine Kingdom of Baylore|Baylore]].
