<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → [[Races]] → Half-Elves</sup></sup>
A hybrid between [[High Elves]] and [[Humans]], Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their Elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their human side. While Half-Elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be human-like in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue. 
#### Half-Elves in Baylore
