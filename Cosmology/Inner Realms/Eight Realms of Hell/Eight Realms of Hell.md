<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] â†’ Eight Realms of Hell</sup></sup> 
A plane of existence that is considered by some to be one of the most dangerous places in the multiverse, the Realms of Hell consist of eight demiplane-like realms similar in structure to Hell's sister plane of existence, the [[Celestial Planes of Heaven]]. Each realm of Hell is vastly different than the next and contains different environments, native creatures, and planar effects but each is ruled over by an [[Devils|Archdevil]].
