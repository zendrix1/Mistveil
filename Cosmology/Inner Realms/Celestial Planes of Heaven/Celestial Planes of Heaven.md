<sup><sup>[[Mistveil]] → Celestial Planes of Heavens</sup></sup> 
One of the major planes of existence in the [[Sea of Dreams]], the Celestial Planes of Heaven are made up of several smaller realms similar to the structure of its sister plane, the [[Eight Realms of Hell]]. The realms of Heaven are inhabited by many different types of creatures but each is ruled over by an [[Angels|Archangel]], whom each embody a different universal law, at least from their perspective. These [[Angels|Archangels]]' underlings police the multiverse enforcing these laws and dishing out punishment to those who break them. Each plane shares its name with the [[Angels|Archangel]] that rules it with the exception of [[Abilon]], the only realm whose original [[Angels|Archangel]] is no longer in command.
